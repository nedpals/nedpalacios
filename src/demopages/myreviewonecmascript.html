    <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
    <div class="video-box">

    <p>The history of JavaScript has an interesting history if you are into the world of programming language. The first interesting fact I was curious about is the creation of the language in 10 days. This is something we cannot achieve anymore because nowadays creating a programming language became more complex in the past 20+ years because of factors such as the security attacks, performance, and etc. Huge props to Brandon Eich for that.</p>
    <p>Another thing to point out is the browser wars of the 2000s. The attitude of Microsoft in that era is hostile and I&#39;m glad that this was not the case nowadays with them truly involved in the standards and making sure that it will benefit anymore. However, we are experiencing a similar situation once again with Google being the main villain for developing and implementing standards for Chrome in the name of being &quot;stewards of the internet&quot;. Let&#39;s just hope that the JavaScript the web designers and developers adored won&#39;t be destroyed for the sake of browser dominance and owning the ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>What is Vanilla JavaScript?</h2>
    <div class="video-box">
      <div class="inner">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nda34efbxhM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The video talks about the term &quot;Vanilla JS&quot; and debunks if it&#39;s another framework similar to React or Angular. Within one minute and ten seconds, the video delivered and explained it in a straightforward manner. Another thing I&#39;d like to point in the video is the use of ice cream as a good analogy for comparing the plain JavaScript to the frameworks. However, the video gave a poor flavor to JQuery which is contrary to what is says, is still popular even up to this day.</p>
    <p>With that said, it is very easy for beginners like me to be driven away by so-called &quot;professionals&quot; to learn frameworks first before the core language itself and just copy-paste the solution code from Stack Overflow or any other site to fix issues. This is plain wrong and this is one thing the education system not just here but in parts of the world. It may still be reasonable in the past because of the inconsistencies of the implementation across browser but nowadays there&#39;s no reason to not use plain JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>What's Google Saying about JavaScript in 2021?</h2>
    <div class="video-box">
      <div class="inner">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YG4-l3VaOWc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The video talks about the state of JavaScript in terms of the Google search popularity and how it is perceived by the sites as per collection of the Google Knowledge graph. In summary, just like any other established programming languages out there, it came to a point that it matured enough for general needs of the programmer and committees behind these programming languages including JavaScript are just finding ways to modernize the language for the sake of relevance and catching up with latest trends which might be a fad or not.</p>
    <p>One thing I&#39;d like to point out as someone who had practicing programming for the past years is that it is very difficult for someone to recommend a programming language to learn without a goal. For example, if you want to build games you need to learn either C# or C++ or if you want to build a website you need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you just spew out lots of programming language names, the person gets overwhelmed and perceived it as difficult and infuriating. Another thing I have learned in this video is that trends does not matter and at the end of the day the programming languages we all learn have value in the products or projects we build. After all, a programming language is just a tool and picking the right tool can lead you to a productive work.</p>

    <h2 id="in-summary">In summary...</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, formally called ECMAScript as a specification, is a fascinating programming language to explore. The language had many events to endure before being fully embraced by web designers and developers. Furthermore, it even expanded outside the browser and became a general-purpose programming language thanks to projects such as Node.JS. Let us all thank and appreciate Netscape for standardizing JavaScript and because of it, it had consistent behaviors across browsers and a vibrant ecosystem was created. Website interactions became more richer because of it. Even if haters and critics say that JavaScript is &quot;dead&quot;, it&#39;s vibrant soul lives on.</p>
